# Covariance_modeling

This is just a collection of scripts that I've found helpful for editing the results of RNA covariance modeling using the Infernal suite of tools: https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/infernal

Note: This is NOT a complete workflow, just a storage of useful code for future reference and use.
